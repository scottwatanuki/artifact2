              <div class="intro-secondary">I'm a first-year student here at Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in Computer Science. I have always been fascinated by the impact that technology can bring to millions of people across the globe. Notably, the world around us has become digitized in many ways. Additionally, artworks have also transformed and are now able to be distributed to a wider audience through digital technology. This website is one representation of how digital technology has changed our lives and how artwork can be presented through digital technology!</div>
